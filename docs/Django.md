# Django

[Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/) is a Python Web Framework. It is one of the most popular Web Frameworks in the world. Compared to other Python Web Frameworks, Django is a batteries-included framework, meaning, a lot of functionality (Database, administration, authentication, etc.) comes with it. This saves time during development, but creates a learning curve for newcomers.

## Django and our project

🤔 You may notice that the current repository name is `startsmart-backend-version`. It's a bit of a misnomer. While the backend logic is found in this repository, we are currently using Django for both the Frontend and Backend implementation. This repository contains the entire system, using Django. 

What does this mean?

- ✂ Frontend and backend are not very separated, compared to other stacks. Django relies on templates to generate webpages.
- 🤓 You need to be **confident** Django to develop the backend
- 😊 You need to be **familiar** with Django to develop the frontend
- 🏃‍♀️ Full project implementation is *sped* up by using many of Django's awesome tools
- 🌟 Implementation is simplified by using only one framework
- 📉 Frontend implementation is *limited* by what you can do within Django (i.e. no SPAs)
