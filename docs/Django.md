# Django

[Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/) is a Python Web Framework. It is one of the most popular Web Frameworks in the world. Compared to other Python Web Frameworks, Django is a batteries-included framework, meaning, a lot of functionality (Database, administration, authentication, etc.) comes with it. This saves time during development, but creates a learning curve for newcomers.

## Django and our project

We are currently using Django for both the Frontend and Backend implementation. This repository contains the entire system, using Django. 

What does this mean?

- ✂ Frontend and backend are not very separated, compared to other stacks. Django relies on templates to generate webpages.
- 🤓 You need to be **confident** Django to develop the backend
- 😊 You need to be **familiar** with Django to develop the frontend
- 🏃‍♀️ Full project implementation is *sped* up by using many of Django's awesome tools
- 🌟 Implementation is simplified by using only one framework
- 📉 Frontend implementation is *limited* by what you can do within Django (i.e. no SPAs)


## Django as a Frontend Developer

For a Django Fullstack Web App, web pages are served via templates, which are HTML files. The backend populates those templates with data from the database.

What you need to know:

* A lil python
* Be familiar with Django views and models.
